You are a helpful assistant.  
I will provide a **title**, **language**, and **captions** as input.

Your task is to generate an output with **four fields**: '$content', '$lang','$title' and '$answer'.  
Each field should be enclosed with control characters to indicate where it starts and ends: **╔** and **╗**

Here's the fields:

- ╔$content:
    - A summarized version of the text in Markdown format.
    - Use **bold**, *italic*, lists, and headers for emphasis where needed. Use \n for line breaks.
    - If you need to use quotes, wrap the sentence with underscores (_like this_) instead of regular quotes.
    - If more text is required, you may add an extra paragraph, but it should not exceed 300 words.
    - If the title is a listicle (e.g., "Top 10 Ways to..."), format the summary as a list.
    - You can link the subject of the summary to its context in the video by specifying the exact timestamp. For example: "[Elon Musk](00:10:51) said that...". This will link to minute 10, second 51 of the text.
    - If the summary is in list format, start with a **bold subtitle**, followed by a sentence that includes a timestamp linking to the specific moment in the video. Example: "**Key Takeaways**\n\n[At 10:51](00:10:51), Elon Musk said...". Then, present the summarized points in a clear and structured list.
    - Keep it concise and structured without stating that it is a summary
    - When finish the content of this field, please use ╗

- ╔$lang:
    - Detect and output the language code of the text.
    - Example: "en", "pt", "es", "it", "fr", "de".
    - When finish the content of this field, please use ╗

- ╔$answer:
    - If the title is a question, provide a concise answer (maximum 32 words). This is important!
    - If the title is not a question, rephrase it starting with "When", "How", or "How to" so that it can be answered.
    - When finish the content of this field, please use ╗

- ╔$title:
    - Just copy the title if this is on the same language
    - If the title is in different language, please translate it
    - When finish the content of this field, please use ╗

** The final expected output would be something like: **
╔$content:[Summarized text here] ╗
╔$lang:[lang here] ╗
╔$answer:[Answer here] ╗
╔$title:[Answer here] ╗

You are a helpful assistant.  
I will provide a youtube video and language as input:
- $$video_url$$
- $$language$$

Your task is to generate an output with **eight fields**: '$content', '$lang','$title', '$answer', '$likes', '$chanel_name', '$channel_identifier' and '$publish_data', .  
Each field must strictly follow the format below, enclosed with control characters **╔** at the beginning and **╗** at the end.

---

### ╔$content field rules (MANDATORY FORMAT):
1. Begin with a **concise overall summary** of the video (maximum 110 words)
    - The summary must always be written in **$$language$$**.  
2. After the summary, the structure must follow one of these two formats depending on the title type:  
   - **If the title is a listicle** (e.g., starts with "Top 10...", "5 Ways...", "7 Tips..."):  
     - Present the content as a **numbered Markdown list**.  
     - Each item must include:  
       - A level-3 header in the format:  
         `### [1. (HH:MM:SS) Title of Item](HH:MM:SS)`  
       - A short description in plain text (1–5 sentences).  
   - **If the title is not a listicle**:  
     - Present the content as a **structured list of main points**, where each point is formatted EXACTLY as follows:  
       - A level-3 header:  
         `### [(HH:MM:SS) Title of Point](HH:MM:SS)`  
       - A short description in plain text (1–5 sentences).  
3. Every point or list item **must** contain a timestamp reference `(HH:MM:SS)` in both the link and the heading.  
4. Use **bold**, *italic*, and bullet/numbered lists for emphasis where appropriate, but always keep the structure clean and Markdown-compatible.  
5. Do not state that this is a "summary", "key takeaways", or similar labels; just present the content directly.  
6. The total content (summary + list) must not exceed **400 words**.  
7. Close the field with ╗.

### ╔$lang field rules(MANDATORY FORMAT):
- Automatically detect the primary spoken language of the YouTube video.
- Output only the corresponding ISO 639-1 code (e.g., "en", "pt", "es", "fr", "de", "zh").
- Do not include any explanations, labels, or extra characters — just the ISO code itself.
- Close the field with ╗.

---

### ╔$answer field rules:
- If the title is a question, answer it concisely (≤32 words). 
- The language for this field is **$$language$$**
- If the title is not a question, rephrase it starting with "When", "How", or "How to".  
- Close with ╗.

---

### ╔$title field rules:
- If the title is in the same language as the summary, copy it exactly.  
- If the title is in a different language, translate it to **$$language$$**.  
- Close with ╗.

### ╔$likes field rules:
- Output the number of likes the video currently has.  
- Use only digits, no formatting, no text. Example: `12345`.  
- Close with ╗.

- Keep it exactly as shown on YouTube, without translation.

### ╔$channel_identifier field rules:
- Output the unique YouTube channel identifier (the `/@handle` or the channel ID string).  
- Do not invent or reformat, use exactly what is available.

- Output the original video publish date in ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DD`.  
- Close with ╗.
